TAC scripts
This is a repository of python scripts developed by TAC leveraging on-box Python which is available from IOS-XE 16.5.1+ on ASR1k, ISR4k and cat3k/cat9k and from IOS-XE 16.6.1 on CSR1000v.

Guestshell and on-box Python overview
Guestshell is a LXC container with CentOS running inside on x86 platforms (routers) and MontaVista container on MIPS platforms (switches).    bootflash: is mounted as /bootflash/ inside the container.
Python2.7 is pre-installed as well as cli library which returns outputs of any Cisco IOS command.

Installation
Create VirtualPortGroup interface for a container, assign an ip address and enable NAT

interface VirtualPortGroup0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 ip nat inside
interface GigabitEthernet1
 ip nat outside
ip access-list extended NAT-ACL
 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
ip nat inside source list NAT-ACL interface GigabitEthernet1 overload

Enable IOX and Guest shell by providing an IP address from the same subnet as VirtualPortGroup interface and specifying correct DNS server, which will be added to /etc/resolv.conf:

Pre IOS-XE 16.7
iox
end
guestshell enable VirtualPortGroup 0 guest-ip 192.168.1.2 name-server 144.254.71.184

Post IOS-XE 16.7
iox
app-hosting appid guestshell
vnic gateway1 virtualportgroup 0 guest-interface 0 guest-ipaddress 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1 name-server 144.254.71.184
end

guestshell enable
At this point Guest Shell should be working.

Let's login to the guest shell to verify that it is working:

Router# guestshell
[guestshell@guestshell ~]$
Great! It is working!

Let's also install some useful yum packages:
sudo yum -y install git nano
sudo pip install --upgrade pip

Let's now clone this repository from box
$ wget <URL>
